# **Rate your plants**

This is a social media platform for plant lovers! One can create an account, post pictures of their favorite plants with information about them as well as rate them in order of difficulty to care for. A signed in user can also save other users posts in order to keep a sort of “wish list” of plants.

This project is the final of 5 projects that need to be completed to receive a diploma in Fullstack Software Development from The Code Institute.

## **UX**

### **User Demographic**

This application has been designed for pets of all kinds and ages who want to share content and make some new friends!
Make your pet a profile, add a post and start interacting with fellow pets! 

### **Site Goals**

The goal for this site has been to build a content sharing platform to allow users to make social media profiles for their pets, add posts, follow and unfollow other users, vote or downvote for posts, as well as save them, and reply to other users' posts too! You can also use the provided search bar to search through the posts with a keyword or a user's name. 


### **Audience**

For your pets! Especially those looking to make new friends. For users who just want to see photos of pets!


### **User Stories**
User Stories and Backend Tasks can be found in this GitHub repository project Kanban board, and for this project, all user stories can be found [here](https://github.com/users/JodyMurray/projects/11)

## **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**
The colour scheme was chosen from researching trending colour schemes on this website:
[coolers](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending).
- The background colour for the app is  *rgb(249, 251, 251)*
- The background colour for the content boxes is *rgb(246, 239, 245)*
- The background colour for the NavBar is a linear-gradient *(to right, rgba(241, 231, 254), rgba(213, 184, 255))*
- The background colour for the downVotes and saved icons in posts is *rgb(7, 108, 108)*
- The background colour for headings in the signup/in page is *rgb(122,	33,	178)*
- The background colour for the "light" buttons is *rgb(122, 33, 178), rgb(221, 198, 236)*
- The background colour for the unfollow button is *rgb(139, 227, 218), rgb(46, 205, 189)*

The colour palette in order as mentioned above.
The source to put this palette together was [here](https://colorhunt.co/)

### **Images**

All images for the website's pages were sourced through google and stored on Cloudinary.

The images used for the posts and pet profiles were sourced from google, but mostly from pets I live with (Yoda) and my friend's pets. 

## **Features**

### **NavBar**

### **Post Page**

- The post's page, with the recommended user to follow sidebar.
- Thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to upvote or downvote any post to your desire. Each icon goes a solid colour once a user has clicked on it, these icons will also undo the action if clicked on again.
- On the top right of the post beside the date posted, you have a bookmark icon to save this post, which later you can view in the "Saved" section from the NavBar. If you save a post, it will be indicated by the "bookmark" icon, which goes a solid colour once it's clicked, if clicked again, this will undo the action of saving the post.
- The three dots on the side of the post image is the button to edit or delete your post.
- And the comment section, create, edit, and delete your comments!

![screenshot](documentation/features/PostPage1.png)
![screenshot](documentation/features/PostPage2.png)


### **About Page**

Just a little paragraph about the site! This page will only appear in the NavBar if you are not signed in.

### **PawFeed**

The PawFeed consists of posts from users that you follow.

![screenshot](documentation/features/PawFeed.png)

### **Saved**

The Saved page consists of posts the user has specifically saved for future viewing.

![screenshot](documentation/features/Saved.png)

### **Profile Page**

- Your profile page, or another user's, along with the sidebar of recommended profiles to follow. 
- The profile page contains a bio section, the bars in the corner to edit your profile and change your username or password.

![screenshot](documentation/features/SignUp.png)

### **No results found**
#### The "No results image" will appear when:

* The search bar entry does not exist:

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/NoResults2.png)

* An invalid HTTP request is made:

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/NoResults1.png)

* On the user's profile page, if no posts have been added yet:

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/NoResults3.png)

### **CRUD**
The CRUD functionality for this project is as follows:

* The user can, once signed up to an account, update their profile with a profile picture/bio. They can also update their username and password from the profile page.
* The user can also, once a post has been created, update or delete their post. The three dots on the right of the post's image will either delete the post (and bring you back to the home page once this is done) or edit your post, bringing you to an edit post form.
* Users can also, once they've created a comment on a post, delete or edit their comments. If chosen, editing a comment will bring up a small form to retype your comment and then you can either save or close if you change your mind.
* Users can also upvote, downvote and/or save posts, and you can also undo all of these actions if they changed their minds.
* Users can also follow other users' accounts and unfollow them if they desire.

### **Defensive Design**

* When making a new account, the following message will appear if any of the inputs are left blank:

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/signupDefensive.png)

* Login attempts with the wrong credentials, will show the following message: 

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/loginDefensive.png)

* Login attempts leaving any input blank, will show the following message: 

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/loginDefensive2.png)

* Attempts to save or vote for your posts will show the following messages: 

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/savedDefensive.png)
![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/votePostDefensive.png)

* If you choose to edit or delete your post, clicking the three dots on the right side of the post's image on the post page, will show the following pop-up messages once you hover over each icon, to ensure you know what you're doing before you click:

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/EditPostDefensive.png) 

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/DeletePostDefensive.png)

* In the "Add post" section, leaving the title input blank will show the following message:

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/addPostDefensive.png)

- Users who forget to add an image while creating a post will still see the post published, with a default image as shown below. Going back into the post page and editing the post will allow the user to rechoose an image:

![screenshot](documentation/test_screenshots/defaultImage.png)


### **Future Implementations**
Future plans for this project include:

- Add more fields for a user to add to their profile. Such as location, age, and/or email address and other social media platforms.
- Add a meow/bark feature, similar to "poke" on Facebook, as an alert or notification.
- Add votes and downvotes count to profile stats.
- Add a feature to allow users to see who voted for their posts.
- Allow users to delete their profile.

### **Components**
* Asset.js - component for the spinner seen while the page is loading, used in PostFeed.js, PostsFeed.js, PopularProfiles.js & ProfilePage.js files.

* Avatar.js - component used for displaying the profile image. Used in NavBar.js, Post.js, Profile.js, ProfilePage.js, Reply.js, and ReplyCreateForm.js files.

* MoreDropdown.js - component used for the functionality and display of the icons to edit/delete posts, comments, and profiles. Only shown to the owner of such posts and their profiles.

* NavBar.js - component used for the display of the NavBar, added into the main app.js file to display at the top of the page.

* NotFound.js - component used for displaying an error image and message if an invalid page has been typed in.

### **Manual Testing**
Manual testing for this project was carried out as follows: 
- Users can see sign-in, sign-up, and about pages only when not logged in.
- Users can create a new account.
- Users can then, sign in to their account and then be redirected to the home page.
- Users can log out.
- Once signed in, users can create, vote, save, and reply to posts. They can edit and delete their posts and replies. 
- Users can edit and update their profiles, which include a profile picture, bio entry, and a separate username and password edit feature.
- All NavLinks and buttons go to their destination.
- Clicking on the post image brings you to the post's page.
- You can vote, downvote and save and also undo all of these actions if you change your mind.
- Once you hover over the votes/replies/save icons, they let you know if you need to sign-in to use this feature, and once clicked on if the user is signed out, you will be redirected to the sign-in page.
- The user is notified of what each icon represents. In each post page, if the user is the owner, the three dots to the right side of the post image will bring up the edit and delete feature, both icons have an overlay trigger to indicate which one does what feature.
- The site was continuously built on google chrome, and once built, it was successfully tested on firefox browser, and safari browser. The only issue found on safari was the inability to sign-in properly, which was resolved after some research on Slack. (mentioned and detailed in the fixed bugs section below)

### **Fixed bugs and solutions**

- TokenTimestamp wasn't functioning as it should.
    * Solution: A spelling error fix solved the issue.

- The reply count upon testing wasn't going up in count as a reply is added.
    * Solution: The variable was wrongly named "replies_count", resolved once renamed "reply_count".

- For smaller screen sizes, the nav link's text and icons are stacked on top of each other.
    * Solution: Reduce padding, and size of the font and reduce the margin on the logo as it was pushing everything to the right.

- An error logged to the console for the logo/favicon image. 
    * Solution: I deleted the original favicon.io 16x16 images when I first opened the project, once these were added, the error disappeared.

- Errors would show up in the console claiming that there were several icons with "class" instead of "className" from copying and pasting from font awesome.
    * Solution: Searching all icons in the sidebar on GitHub, this was quickly resolved.

- When the reply icon was clicked on, the page wasn't redirecting to the reply section on the post page.
    * Solution: There was an unnecessary space in the link - {posts/$id}.

- There was an issue with logging in through safari, once I added the credentials it would jump back to the sign-in page.
    * Solution: Upon researching in Slack, the issue was with the JWT json web token as a HTTP-only cookie in the browser,
    in the settings in Safari, enabling "Allow cross-website tracking" resolved the issue and it was possible to sign-in.


### **Unfixed bugs**
- No unfixed bugs to report during the production of this project.

- One thing to note is when doing the lighthouse report, best practices for the sign-in and sign-up page show a result of 75, the image shows up tagged as low resolution.
- There are errors in the console of these pages, that were also brought up during the walkthrough Moments. The errors are as follows:

*Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)*


## **Deployment**

### **GitHub**
The following bullet points detail the steps gone through to set up this project on GitHub:
- Create a Repository on GitHub (Not using any Code Institue Template).
- Create a new workspace. Once the workspace has started, run the following command in the terminal window:

    *npx create-react-app . --template git+https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/cra-template-moments.git --use-npm*

- Enter "y" to confirm installing the create-react-app package.
- Once the packages have been installed, run *npm start* to check that react is working correctly.
- Once you can see it's running efficiently, go into the App.js file and remove the React Custom header and replace it with a test text "Hello, world!", and remove the logo import at the top of the page.
- In the preview window, you should see the test text show up now.
- Once you see this test text, add, commit, and push your changes.

### **Heroku**
The following bullet points detail the steps gone through to set up this project on Heroku:
- In Heroku: Click on the "new" button and follow the steps to create a new app, noting that a unique name is required.
- Once your unique name is chosen and you've selected your appropriate region, click "Create app".
- Once this app is created, in the "deploy" tab in Heroku, you can connect this to your GitHub repository.
- From the "Deployment method" section, choose GitHub, enter the name of the repo just created and use the search feature to find it, and then click "connect".
- When you've successfully connected your repo. Go to the 'Manual Deploy' section and click 'Deploy Branch'. Click on 'build logs' to monitor the build and ensure deployment is successful. The build is completed when the log says 'Build succeeded!'.
- Next step is to install Bootstrap 4, by typing the following command in the terminal window:

    *npm install react-bootstrap@1.6.3 bootstrap@4.6.0*
